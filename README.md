# CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) – Study Resources & My Roadmap to Certification

Welcome to my Security+ study repository! This repo contains all the resources, notes, and tools I personally used to pass the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam.

I created this to help others studying for the exam and to track my own journey through the certification process.

## What Helped Me Pass

- **NPower Cybersecurity Program** – Provided hands-on training, structured curriculum, and labs.
- **Quizlet Flashcard Sets** – I created and used custom flashcards for rapid memorization of key concepts.
- **Professor Messer Practice Exams** – Reinforced knowledge and exposed me to realistic question formats.

## My Tips for Passing

1. **Master acronyms early** – They show up everywhere on the test.
   
2. **Focus on understanding, not memorization** – Know the *why* behind the protocols and controls.

3. **Use practice exams** to simulate test-day pressure and catch weak areas.

4. **Don’t skip performance-based questions (PBQs)** – Practice troubleshooting scenarios.

5.  **Utilize AI as much as you can. For example... Having a tough time remembering a technical term, type into AI "write me some common real world analogies that relate to this 'cybersecurity' concept" (ChatGPT)**
      - Also use AI for making your own custom practice tests, or even ask it for a variety of study retention methods, and see what works bests for you!
