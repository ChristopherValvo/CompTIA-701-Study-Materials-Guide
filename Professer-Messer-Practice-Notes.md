Why I Recommend Professor Messer

While I can’t include Professor Messer’s paid materials here, I highly recommend his content to anyone preparing for the Security+ exam.

His resources are:
	•	Well-structured and beginner-friendly – even complex topics are broken down clearly.
	•	Aligned with the SY0-701 objectives – he teaches exactly what you need to know.
	•	Full of free videos and notes – great for reviewing concepts at your own pace.
	•	Supported by high-quality practice questions – especially useful for simulating the actual exam experience.

His YouTube channel and website are a fantastic starting point, and if you’re willing to invest a little, the practice exams and study guides are 100% worth it. It was one of the best decisions I made during my prep.
